# Video-Classification-Assignment
This is an Ipython Notebook to demonstrate Classification of Videos on Running and Jogging data with 2 datasets of 52 samples of both running and jogging videos.


For implementing the code at your end implement each cell one by one. The only thing you need to change is set the directory of the dataset based on where you kept the dataset.

Rest is easy running and executing each cell.
